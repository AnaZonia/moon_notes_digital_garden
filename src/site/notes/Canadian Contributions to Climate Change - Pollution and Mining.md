[The “Canada Brand”: Violence and Canadian Mining Companies in Latin America - Justice & Corporate Accountability Project](https://justice-project.org/the-canada-brand-violence-and-canadian-mining-companies-in-latin-america/)


Senator Rosa Galvez (Peruvian-Canadian) gave a talk on how Canada is very far behind on its climate goals.

Canada emits much more per capita and it's not just because of the cold, as other cold nations don't have the same emissions.

# Story
Educated professionals of the Global North have great power to help change the course of the climate crisis - and with this power, comes responsibility.

# 1. Why is it interesting or significant for non-academic readers? (100 word limit)
Often, citizens of countries like Canada, that have access to a breadth of 
# Idea 1) Local government – what is happening where I’m from?

- Looking up what climate-related, good and bad, decisions are being made by politicians in your city/province/country. What about the world?... leads to idea 3
- We can make a full discussion about global decision making and scale of impact of decisions.
- From this, we can conclude that choosing the correct leader is probably the most important factor in such an urgent situation – and in such a polarized world, tough conversations must be had… which leads us to idea 2

# Idea 2) Climate-centered conversations with different opinions – the importance of open discourse and changing minds with openness and reason

- Juliann mentioned social media – looking over tweets and comments from climate deniers and thinking about how to answer them properly. I think it’s a great idea!
- We could also think about answering essays/youtube videos/political commentary from the other side with accessible, clear language (I loved the lecture example of throwing dice in a casino vs greta’s “the house is on fire”! maybe we could go further on that? Writing short paragraphs – the size of a text message to a family member that has, say, shared such video in the family group chat?)

# Idea 3) Developing countries – responsibilities over the large scale

- Where are the major climate-centered decisions being made? The power of the governments of the US, Brazil, China, the EU, the G7 (including Canada). Where are the emissions of Europeans mostly coming from? (spoiler alert, it’s not Europe! – Morgane Henry, from Switzerland, may be of help here.)

- Europe/Canada have trains and bike lanes… How much of the world population does not have such luxuries? Citizens of the global north do indeed have larger carbon footprints on average than citizens of the global south – but a lot of the emissions of the global north are done by companies exploiting, polluting, in the Global South.
- The power of the Global North over the Global South:

- Can be good if empowering (Dr. Philip Fearnside)
- Can be bad if exploitative (Canadian mining)

- From this, we can get that us, as well-educated citizens of the global north, have great power. Individual action is important, but it is the bare minimum – we have the opportunity, the tools, the privilege to go way beyond. In whatever area you are, odds are you’ll be more influential as a professional than most of the world’s population ever could, and you can collaborate to bridge the gap between the global north and the global south to make meaningful, large scale climate action.
