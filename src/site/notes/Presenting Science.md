## Public Speaking
### Know your goal and your audience
- Start explaining from what your audience knows.
- Use metaphors!
### Define your message
- Less is more. *What do they need to know?*

(fun fact - Hemingway does not agree with this principle!)
### Raise their interest - *Start with a hook!*

### Structure it well
- Don't tell us what you know - tell us what we need to know.
- Define clearly which gap you fill
- Keep methods simple and jargon-free
- Keep conclusion slide with **what** we should remember, **why** we should remember it and potentially a call to action.
### Deliver it well
- take pauses
- speak slowly
- vary your tone to keep people engaged
- look at your audience
- speak at the speed of the audience's thoughts
- Keep good body posture
