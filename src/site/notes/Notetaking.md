[Lessons from Sherlock Holmes: Cultivate What You Know to Optimize How You Decide - Scientific American Blog Network](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/lessons-from-sherlock-holmes-cultivate-what-you-know-to-optimize-how-you-decide/)

> [!quote ] A Study in Scarlet, Conan Doyle
> I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.

**1. Always take fleeting notes**
**2. Be selective with what you write down**
	Hardest part for me, for sure. Must let go of the FOMO and not write literally everything down.
**3. Make notes permanent, connected, developed, argued**
	Get notes from fleeting to processed ASAP!
**4. Link, transfer, associate the notes**
	Keep structures simple so it's easier to flow.
**5. Write around already-developed notes**
	Writing more, since that is where ideas happen.

How to Take Smart Notes - Sonke Ahrens is a book that summarizes the Zettelkasten system.

## Where to learn [[Obsidian\|Obsidian]]?


[Anki](http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html) is a flashcard system that helps memorize specific things. Could be useful for language learning, or terminology. For now I don't feel an immediate need to add it as a task, but if in the future I want to do anything with it, there's a way to link it to Obsidian.
