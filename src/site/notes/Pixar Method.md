Once upon a time, there was a big forest that had been cut down and burned to give space for agriculture.

Every day, farms were abandoned so new baby forests could grow on the empty land, but it was hard to predict how quickly they would grow back.

Then one day, we decided to learn how the ways in which the land was burned and cropped would change the way the forest grows.

Because of that we could consider how the quality of the soil can affect regrowing forests

And because of that we can make better predictions of how these forests will grow

Until finally we can better plan where reforestation efforts should be implemented to bring the forest back faster
