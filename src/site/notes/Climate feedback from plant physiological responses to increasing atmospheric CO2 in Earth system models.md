> [!note] Summary
> CO2 fertilization may not necessarily lead directly to bigger carbon sinks, because through stomata closure there may be drying that would then lead to lower carbon uptake. This however may be dependent on whether plants would make up to the stomata closure by [[Leaf Area Index\|Leaf Area Index]] increases, which could keep carbon uptake high and reduce drought.

stomatal closure has hydrological effects, but we dont know if the transpiration decline can cause regional changes

Humboldt - deforestation and drought?

Different areas of the Amazon have rainfall be more sensitive to deforestation and others more sensitive to CO2.

There is a question whether rainfall decrease would decrease soil moisture to the point of restricting growth. So far, models

Leaf area index (greening) increases in the Amazon. why?
- outcome of CO2 fertilization - there may be more transpiration because of larger leaves
a tradeoff with leaf area index could increase surface evapotranspiration and counteract the effect of the closed stomata.

Stomata (physiological response) are dominant in earth system models, but in real world there may be change in LAI (did he say that LAI and stomata closing when considered together still led to drying?)
